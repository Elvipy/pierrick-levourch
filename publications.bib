	abstract = {In this paper we provide a novel strategy to prove the validity of Hartree's theory for the ground state energy of bosonic quantum systems in the mean-field regime. For the well-known case of trapped Bose gases, this can be shown using the strong quantum de Finetti theorem, which gives the structure of infinite hierarchies of k-particles density matrices. Here we deal with the case where some particles are allowed to escape to infinity, leading to a lack of compactness. Our approach is based on two ingredients: (1) a weak version of the quantum de Finetti theorem, and (2) geometric techniques for many-body systems. Our strategy does not rely on any special property of the interaction between the particles. In particular, our results cover those of Benguria-Lieb and Lieb-Yau for, respectively, bosonic atoms and boson stars.},

Bresch, P. Noble and J.--P. Vila, (2016)] introduced for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a linear density dependent shear viscosity and a zero bulk viscosity. As a concrete application, this helps to justify mathematically the convergence between global weak solutions of the quantum Navier-Stokes system [recently obtained simultaneously by I. Lacroix-Violet and A. Vasseur (2017)] and dissipative solutions of the quantum Euler system when the viscosity coefficient tends to zero: This selects a dissipative solution as the limit of a viscous system. We also get weak-strong uniqueness for the Quantum-Euler and for the Quantum-Navier-Stokes equations. Our results are based on the fact that Euler-Korteweg systems and corresponding Navier--Stokes-Korteweg systems can be reformulated through an augmented system such as the compressible Navier-Stokes system with density dependent viscosities satisfying the BD algebraic relation. This was also observed recently [by D. Bresch, F. Couderc, P. Noble and J.--P. Vila, (2016)] for the Euler-Korteweg system for numerical purposes. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that this augmented formulation helps to define relative entropy estimates for the Euler Korteweg systems in a simplest way compared to recent works [See D. Donatelli, E. Feireisl, P. Marcati (2015) and J. Giesselmann, C. Lattanzio, A.-E. Tzavaras (2017)] with less hypothesis required on the capillary coefficient.},

The relaxation parameter is linked to the viscosities of the different fluids (which may be small for applications) and the relaxed quantity is linked to the laws chosen at interfaces of the two-fluid system at a mesoscale.},

By achieving this, we are able to take into account general fourth order symmetric viscous-stress tensors with coefficients depending smoothly on the time-space variables. More precisely, in space dimensions \$d=2,3\$, under periodic boundary conditions, considering a pressure law \$p({\textbackslash}rho)=a{\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}\$ whith \$a{\textgreater}0\$ respectively \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}geq d/(4-d)\$) and under the assumption that the norms of the initial data \${\textbackslash}left( {\textbackslash}rho\_\{0\}-M,u\_\{0\}{\textbackslash}right) {\textbackslash}in L{\textasciicircum}\{2{\textbackslash}gamma\}{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}mathbb\{T\}{\textasciicircum}\{d\}{\textbackslash}right) {\textbackslash}times(H{\textasciicircum}\{1\}({\textbackslash}mathbb\{T\}{\textasciicircum}\{d\})){\textasciicircum}\{d\}\$ are sufficiently small, we are able to construct global weak solutions.

As a byproduct of our method we obtain sharp estimates for the principal eigenvalue of Schrödinger operators on some non-flat non-compact manifolds, which to the best of our knowledge are new. The method relies on generalized entropy functionals for nonlinear diffusion equations. It opens a new area of research for approaches related to carré du champ methods on non-compact manifolds. However, key estimates depend as much on curvature properties as on purely nonlinear effects. The method is well adapted to functional inequalities involving simple weights and also applies to general cylinders. Beyond results on symmetry and symmetry breaking, and on optimal constants in functional inequalities, rigidity theorems for nonlinear elliptic equations can be deduced in rather general settings.},

We prove that with a simple stochastic model, interfacial and relaxation terms are equivalent to the evaluation of an integral, which cannot be explicitly computed in general. However, in different particular case matching with a large range of applications (topology of the bubbles/droplets, or special flow regime conditions), the interfacial and relaxation parameters can be explicitly computed, leading to different models that are either nonlinear versions or slight modifications of previously proposed models. The validity domains of previously proposed models are clarified, and some modeling parameters of the averaged system are linked with the local topology of the flow.

Our main goal is to find a set of general and realistic sufficient conditions to guarantee the global existence of smooth solutions, and possibly to investigate their asymptotic behavior. For systems which are entropy dissipative, a quite natural generalization of the Kawashima condition for hyperbolic-parabolic systems can be given. In this paper, we first propose a general framework for this kind of problem, by using the so-called entropy variables. Then we go on to prove some general statements about the global existence of smooth solutions, under different sets of conditions. In particular, the present approach is suitable for dealing with most of the physical examples of systems with a relaxation extension. Our main tools will be some refined energy estimates and the use of a suitable version of the Kawashima condition.},

	abstract = {This paper is the second of the series of two papers, which focuses on the derivation of an averaged 1D model for compressible bubbly flows. For this, we start from a microscopic description of the interactions between a large but finite number of small bubbles with a surrounding compressible fluid. This microscopic model has been derived and analysed in the first paper. In the present one, provided physical parameters scale according to the number of bubbles, we prove that solutions to the microscopic model exist on a timespan independent of the number of bubbles. Considering then that we have a large number of bubbles, we propose a construction of the macroscopic variables and derive the averaged system satisfied by these quantities. Our method is based on a compactness approach in a strong-solution setting. In the last section, we propose the derivation of the Williams-Boltzmann equation corresponding to our setting.},

The Lagrangian functional, defining the Action, is composed of a kinetic energy, accounting for interface feature, and a potential energy. The key element of the model lies on the assumption that the interface separating the two phases admits its own internal energy, satisfying a Gibbs form including both surface tension and interfacial area. Thus surface tension is taken into account both in the potential energy and the kinetic one which define the Lagrangian functional. Applying the SAP allows to build a set of partial differential equations modelling the dynamics of the two-phase flow. It includes evolution equations of the volume fraction and the interfacial area, accounting for mechanical relaxation terms. The final model is shown to be well posed (hyperbolicity, Lax entropy).},

The basic system of one-dimensional two-phase flow equations for this problem possesses complex characteristics, exhibits unbounded instabilities in the short-wavelength limit, and constitutes an improperly posed initial value problem. These difficulties have led some workers to propose major modifications to the basic equation system. We show that the relatively minor modification of introducing surface tension is sufficient to render the characteristics real, stabilize short-wavelength disturbances, and produce a properly posed problem. For a given value of the surface tension, the basic equation system thus modified is shown to correctly predict the evolution of small-amplitude disturbances having wavelengths long compared to the plate spacing. A formula is given for the artificial surface tension necessary to stabilize wavelengths on the order of the mesh spacing in a finite difference numerical calculation. A brief discussion is given concerning the expected behavior of surface tension as compared to viscosity in the nonlinear regime. The general relation between characteristics and stability is discussed in an appendix.},

We consider two kinds of boundary conditions. The first one is the no-slip condition. In this case we extend the famous conditional result (Kato, T.: Remarks on zero viscosity limit for nonstationary Navier-Stokes flows with boundary. In: Seminar on nonlinear partial differential equations, vol. 2, pp. 85-98. Math. Sci. Res. Inst. Publ.; Berkeley 1984) obtained by Kato in the homogeneous incompressible case. Kato proved that if the energy dissipation rate of the viscous flow in a boundary layer of width proportional to the viscosity vanishes then the solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to some solutions of the incompressible Euler equations in the energy space. We provide here a natural extension of this result to the compressible case. The other case is the Navier condition which encodes that the fluid slips with some friction on the boundary. In this case we show that the convergence to the Euler equations holds true in the energy space, as least when the friction is not too large. In both cases we use in a crucial way some relative energy estimates proved recently by Feireisl et al. in J. Math. Fluid Mech. 14:717-730 (2012). © 2013 Springer Basel.},

First, the system is transformed into a new one of three subsystems: the first subsystem consists of the balance laws in the gas phase, the second subsystem consists of the conservation law of the mass in the solid phase and the conservation law of the momentum of the mixture, and the compaction dynamic equation is considered as the third subsystem. In the first subsystem, stationary waves are used to build up a well-balanced scheme which can capture equilibrium states. The second subsystem is of conservative form and thus can be numerically treated in a standard way. For the third subsystem, the fact that the solid velocity is constant across the solid contact suggests us to compose the technique of the Engquist-Osher scheme. We show that our scheme is capable of capturing exactly equilibrium states. Moreover, numerical tests show the convergence of approximate solutions to the exact solution. © 2011 IMACS.

This is a 2D hyperbolic non-conservative system of equations that is mathematically equivalent to the Reynolds-averaged model of barotropic turbulent flows. The model has three families of characteristics corresponding to the propagation of surface waves, shear waves and average flow (contact characteristics). The system is non-conservative: for six unknowns (the fluid depth, two components of the depth averaged horizontal velocity, and three independent components of the symmetric Reynolds stress tensor) one has only five conservation laws (conservation of mass, momentum, energy and mathematical ‘entropy’). A splitting procedure for solving such a system is proposed allowing us to define a weak solution. Each split subsystem contains only one family of waves (either surface or shear waves) and contact characteristics. The accuracy of such an approach is tested on 2D analytical solutions describing the flow with linear with respect to the space variables velocity, and on the solutions describing 1D roll waves. The capacity of the model to describe the full transition scenario as commonly seen in the formation of roll waves: from uniform flow to 1D roll waves, and, finally, to 2D transverse ‘fingering’ of the wave profiles, is shown.},

	abstract = {An extension of the Boussinesq-type models to weakly compressible flows is derived in the fully nonlinear case. The dispersive properties are consistent with the linear theory of compressible fluids at the long-wave limit. The particular case of a vanishing Mach number gives a quasi-incompressible model, intended for coastal wave simulations, which is a hyperbolic version of the Serre–Green–Naghdi equations, with a new treatment of the bathymetric terms. Both the compressible and quasi-incompressible models are hyperbolic four-equation models on an arbitrary bathymetry, with an exact equation of energy conservation. In addition, these models are extended to hyperbolic and fully nonlinear five-equation versions with improved dispersive properties. A remarkable property of the quasi-incompressible model with improved dispersive properties is that it is possible to decrease significantly the sound velocity, and thus the computational time, with the same accuracy or even slightly better. The numerical results show good agreement of the quasi-incompressible model with experimental data and the capability of the compressible model to calculate the decrease of tsunami velocity due to compressible effects.},

            This book provides an introduction to the mathematical theory of homogenization, which describes the replacement of a real composite material by a fictitious homogeneous one. The aim of the theory is to describe the macroscopic properties of the composite by taking into account the properties of the microscopic structure. The first four chapters cover variational methods for partial differential equations, which is the natural framework of homogenization theory. The text then discusses the homogenization of several kinds of second order boundary value problems. Particular attention is given to the classical examples of the steady and non-steady heat equations, the wave equation and the linearized system of elasticity. All topics are illustrated by figures and numerous examples.},

	abstract = {Gatekeepers to the open space, launchers are subject to intense and competitive enhancements, through experimental and numerical test campaigns. Predictive numerical simulations have become mandatory to increase our understanding of the physics. Adjustable, they provide early-stage optimization processes, in particular of the combustion chamber, to guarantee safety and maximize efficiency. One of the major physical phenomena involved in the combustion of the fuel and oxidizer is the jet atomization, which pilots both the droplet distributions and the potential high-frequency instabilities in subcritical conditions. It encompasses a large spectrum of two-phase flow topologies, from separated phases to disperse phase, with a mixed region where the small scale physics and topology of the flow are very complex. Reducedorder models are good candidates to perform predictive but low CPU demanding simulations on industrial configurations but have only been able so far to capture large scale dynamics and have to be coupled to disperse phase models through adjustable and weakly reliable parameters in order to predict spray formation. Improving the hierarchy of reduced order models in order to better describe both the mixed region and the disperse region requires a series of building blocks at the heart of the present work and gives on to complex problems in the mathematical analysis and physical modelling of these systems of PDE as well as their numerical discretization and implementation in CFD codes for industrial uses.},

@article{demay_modelisation_nodate,
	title = {Modélisation et simulation d'écoulements transitoires diphasiques eau-air dans les circuits hydrauliques},
	abstract = {The present work is dedicated to the mathematical and numerical modelling of transient air-water ﬂows in pipes which occur in piping systems of several industrial areas such as nuclear or hydroelectric power plants or sewage pipelines. It deals more speciﬁcally with the so-called mixed ﬂows which involve stratiﬁed regimes driven by slow gravity waves, pressurized or dry regimes (pipe full of water or air) driven by fast acoustic waves and entrapped air pockets. An accurate modelling of these ﬂows is necessary to guarantee the operability of the related hydraulic system. While most of available models in the literature focus on the water phase neglecting the air phase, a compressible twolayer model which accounts for air-water interactions is proposed herein. The derivation process relies on a depth averaging of the isentropic Euler set of equations for both phases where the hydrostatic constraint is applied on the water pressure gradient. The resulting system is hyperbolic and satisﬁes an entropy inequality in addition to other signiﬁcant mathematical properties, including the uniqueness of jump conditions and the positivity of heights and densities for each layer. Regarding the discrete level, the simulation of mixed ﬂows with the compressible two-layer model raises key challenges due to the discrepancy of wave speeds characterizing each regime combined with the fast underlying relaxation processes and with phase vanishing when the ﬂow becomes pressurized or dry. Thus, an implicit-explicit fractional step method is derived. It relies on the fast pressure relaxation in addition to a mimetic approach with the shallow water equations for the slow dynamics of the water phase. In particular, a relaxation method provides stabilization terms activated according to the ﬂow regime. Several test cases are performed and attest the ability of the compressible two-layer model to deal with mixed ﬂows in pipes involving air pocket entrapment.},

Cette transition est localisée en des interfaces qui sont produites dynamiquement. On prend également en compte la diffusion de la chaleur, la tension de surface et les forces de gravité. L'application envisagée est la simulation d'écoulements dans un réacteur à eau pressurisée dans l'industrie nucléaire civile. On s'intéresse ici plus précisément à un éventuel fonctionnement accidentel et en particulier au phénomène de la crise d'ébullition. On modélise les écoulements diphasiques avec changement de phase par un modèle basé sur le système des équations d'Euler fermé par une seule équation d'état obtenue en postulant un équilibre instantané et local des pressions, températures et potentiels chimiques de chaque phase. On en étudie ensuite l'hyperbolicité et le problème de Riemann qui lui est associé. Du point de vue numérique, puisqu'il n'y a pas d'expression analytique pour la loi à l'équilibre dans le cas général, on propose une méthode simple pour approcher cette loi d'état lorsque les propriétés des deux phases sont décrites par des lois très générales, éventuellement sous forme tabulée. Enfin, pour simuler des écoulements diphasiques avec changement de phase, on présente un schéma numérique de type relaxation/projection pour lequel la phase de projection utilise cette approximation de l'équilibre thermodynamique.},

Assuming that the fluids interface, which is a free boundary, is described by curves of uniformly bounded variation, we prove that the limit problem obeys a generalized Reynolds law. Moreover, when the two sides of the gap are fixed, the saturation of the limit problem is solution of the classical Buckley–Leverett equation.},

Continuing where the previous volume left off, the author considers the maximum principle from the viewpoints of both viscous approximation and numerical schemes. Convergence is studied through compensated compactness. The author applies this tool to the description of large amplitude wave propagation. Small waves are studied through geometrical optics. Special structures are presented in chapters on rich and Temple systems. Finally, Serre explains why the initial-boundary value problem is far from trivial, with descriptions of the Kreiss-Lopatinski condition for well-posedness, with applications to shock wave stability, and certain problems in boundary layer theory. Throughout the presentation is reasonably self-contained, with large numbers of exercises and full discussion of all the ideas. This will make it ideal as a text for graduate courses in the area of partial differential equations.},

These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},
